COVID-19 Time Series Forecasting
Overview
This project aims to forecast COVID-19 cases using time series analysis techniques. It involves collecting weekly data on COVID-19 cases and deaths, along with various demographic and metric features. The data is analyzed and used to build forecasting models to predict future trends in COVID-19 cases.

Data
The project utilizes two main datasets:

df_covid: Weekly data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, demographics, and metrics.
df_resp: Weekly reported cases for respiratory diseases such as COVID-19, RSV, and Influenza, along with demographics and metrics.
Objective
The main objectives of the project are as follows:
Implement feature engineering to generate additional variables from the original data.
Build time series forecasting models using ARIMA, SARIMA, or other relevant techniques.
Evaluate model performance and provide forecasts for future COVID-19 cases.
