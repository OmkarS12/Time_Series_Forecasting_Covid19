# COVID-19 Time Series Forecasting Overview

This project focuses on predicting COVID-19 cases using time series analysis techniques. With the aim of understanding and forecasting the spread of COVID-19, we collect weekly data on cases and deaths, as well as various demographic and metric features. The insights gained from this analysis can aid in decision-making and resource allocation for managing the pandemic.

## Data

The project leverages two primary datasets:

1. Weekly data encompassing COVID-19 cases, deaths, demographics, and related metrics in Massachusetts.
2. Weekly reported cases for respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, RSV, and Influenza, coupled with demographic information and metrics in Massachusetts.
3. Weekly reported data of Sars-CoV2 Sampling from Wastewater across Massachusetts

## Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Feature Engineering**: Implementing feature engineering techniques to derive additional variables from the original datasets.
2. **Model Building**: Constructing time series forecasting models utilizing techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or other relevant methodologies.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the developed models and providing forecasts for future COVID-19 cases.

## Insights

Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 Concentration Insight: Recent studies have highlighted wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentration as one of the leading predictors of COVID-19 cases. Integrating this insight into our analysis could potentially enhance the accuracy of our forecasting models and contribute to a deeper understanding of the pandemic's dynamics.

By incorporating insights from various data sources and employing sophisticated forecasting techniques, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic and assist in the formulation of effective response strategies.
